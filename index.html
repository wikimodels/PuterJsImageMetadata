1. Follow the SEO-Optimized Title Guidelines:
   - For Images of Living Beings (Humans, Animals, etc.): The title should follow the format: [who or what is in the picture] [with what mood] [what they are doing or what it represents] [against what background]. Example: 'A happy young woman with a bright smile reading a book in a cozy coffee shop.'
   - For Non-Living Images (e.g., Objects, Architecture, Nature): The title should follow the format: [what is depicted in the picture] [in what style] [in what colors] [what it represents or what it is used for]. Example: 'Modern abstract geometric shapes in vibrant red and yellow, symbolizing creativity.'
   - If the Image has Space for Text: If the image has a lot of empty space that could be used for text, add [with copy space] to the title.

2. Give me the keywords that follow the General Guidelines for Keywords:
   - These keywords should cover specific aspects of the image and help improve its discoverability.

   - Keywords must start with more relevant and specific terms and move to more general terms.
   - Make sure you find only 49 keywords. Not more, not less.
